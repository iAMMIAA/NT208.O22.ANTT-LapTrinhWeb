                JERSEY CITY, N.J., March 18, 2024. Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma America, Inc. (MTPA) today announced the publication of results in The Lancet Neurology from the pivotal, Phase 3 BouNDless trial (NCT04006210) evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of investigational ND0612 – a continuous, 24 hours/day subcutaneous (SC) infusion of liquid levodopa/carbidopa (LD/CD) – in comparison to oral immediate-release (IR) LD/CD in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) experiencing motor fluctuations. Results from the study, which met its primary endpoint and the first four secondary endpoints, showed ND0612 was superior at increasing "ON" time without troublesome dyskinesia and reducing "OFF" time, compared to oral IR-LD/CD after 12 weeks.

                "Orally administered levodopa/carbidopa tablets remain the most essential pharmacological intervention in Parkinson's disease; however, over time, the reliability of its benefits can decrease, leading to the onset of motor fluctuations," said Professor Alberto Espay, Principal U.S. Investigator of the BouNDless trial and Director of the James J. and Joan A. Gardner Family Center for Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorders at the University of Cincinnati. "We are encouraged by these positive data, which we believe support ND0612, if approved, as a potential treatment option for people with Parkinson's disease experiencing motor fluctuations who have thus far had limited options."

                <ul>
                    <li>Treatment with ND0612 demonstrated favorable efficacy with a statistically significant addition (p0.0001) of 1.72 hours in "ON" time without troublesome dyskinesia over oral IR-LD/CD, thus meeting the trial's primary endpoint.</li>
                    <li>The trial also demonstrated positive and clinically meaningful results for the first four secondary endpoints, including the key secondary endpoint with an additional 1.4-hour reduction in daily "OFF" time (p0.0001) with ND0612 vs. oral IR-LD/CD.</li>
                    <li>The remaining secondary endpoints that reached statistical significance were the Movement Disorders Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part II scores (-3.05 [-4.28, -1.81], p0.0001), the Patients Global Impression of Change (Odds Ratio [OR]: 5.31 [2.67, 10.58], p0.0001) and Clinician Global Impression of Improvement (OR: 7.23 [3.57, 14.64], p0.0001).</li>
                    <li>Some ISRs (infusion site nodule, infusion site bruising, infusion site infection, infusion site erythema, infusion site pain, infusion site eschar and infusion site swelling) were more frequent in the ND0612 group compared to placebo and oral LD/CD groups. Additionally, only 6% of study participants discontinued the trial during the DBDD period due to any reason – including 5% due to AEs – compared to discontinuation rates of 6% and 3%, respectively, of study participants in the oral LD/CD groups.</li>
                </ul>

                About ND0612
                </h4>
                <p>
                ND0612 is an investigational drug-device combination therapy – a 24-hours/day, continuous subcutaneous (SC) infusion of liquid levodopa/carbidopa (LD/CD) for the treatment of motor fluctuations in people with Parkinson's disease (PD). Development of investigational ND0612 is being led by NeuroDerm, Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation (MTPC). The safety and efficacy of ND0612 in PD is under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), who has assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date for the second quarter of CY (calendar year) 2024.
